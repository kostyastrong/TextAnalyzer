Hello!
When working on a project, you are probably managing many different branches in your repository.

As the number of branches grow, you may need to work on different tasks in parallel, going from one branch to another all the time.

As a consequence, you may need to switch branches very frequently.

In this tutorial, you are going to learn how you can switch branches easily on Git.
