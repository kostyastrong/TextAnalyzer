<p class="pfs90">JUSTIFICATORY EXTRACTS FROM SIR JOHN MOORE’S CORRESPONDENCE.</p>
<p class="p1 center"><em>Sir J. Moore to Mr. Frere. Salamanca, Nov. 27, 1808.</em></p>
<p>“The movements of the French give us little time for discussion. As soon as the British army has formed a junction I must, upon the supposition that Castaños is either beaten or retreated, march upon Madrid, and throw myself into the heart of Spain, and thus run all risks and share the fortunes of the Spanish nation, or I must fall back upon Portugal.” ... “The movement into Spain is one of greater hazard, as my retreat to Cadiz or Gibraltar must be very uncertain. I shall be entirely in the power of the Spaniards, but perhaps this is worthy of risk, if the government and people of Spain are thought to have still sufficient energy, and the means to recover from their defeats;<a id="Page_lxix" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[lxix]"></a> and by collecting in the south be able, with the aid of the British army, to resist, and finally repel, the formidable attack which is prepared against them.”</p>
<p class="p1 center"><em>Sir John Moore’s Journal. Salamanca, Nov. 30, 1808.</em></p>
<p>“In the night of the 28th I received an express from Mr. Stuart, at Madrid, containing a letter from lieut.-colonel Doyle, announcing the defeat of Castaños’s army near Tudela. They seem to have made but little resistance, and are, like Blake’s, flying; this renders my junction with Baird so hazardous that I dare not attempt it; but even were it made, what chance has this army, now that all those of Spain are beaten, to stand against the force which must be brought against it. The French have 80,000 in Spain, and 30,000 were to arrive in 20 days from the 15th of this month. As long as Castaños’s army remained there was a hope, but I now see none. I am therefore determined to withdraw the army.”</p>
<p class="p1 center"><em>Ditto, Dec. 9.</em></p>
<p>“After Castaños’s defeat, the French marched for Madrid, the inhabitants flew to arms, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'barricadoed their'" id="tn-lxix">barricaded their</ins> streets, and swore to die rather than submit. This has arrested the progress of the French, and Madrid still holds out; this is the first instance of enthusiasm shown; there is a chance that the example may be followed, and the people be roused; in which case there is still a chance that this country may be saved. Upon this chance I have stopt Baird’s retreat, and am taking measures to form our junction whilst the French are wholly occupied with Madrid. We are bound not to abandon the cause as long as there is hope; but the courage of the populace of Madrid may fail, or at any rate they may not be able to resist; in short, in a moment things may be as bad as ever, unless the whole country is animated and flock to the aid of the capital, and in this part the people are passive.”</p>
<p class="p1 center"><em>Sir John Moore to lord Castlereagh. Salamanca, Dec. 10, 1808.</em></p>
<p>“I certainly think the cause desperate, because I see no determined spirit any where, unless it be at Zaragoza. There is however a chance, and whilst there is that I think myself bound to run all risks to support it I am now differently situated from what I was when Castaños was defeated: I have been joined by general Hope, the artillery, and all the cavalry (lord Paget, with<a id="Page_lxx" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[lxx]"></a> three regiments, is at Toro); and my junction with sir David Baird is secure, though I have not heard from him since I ordered him to return to Astorga.”</p>
<p class="p1 center"><em>Ditto to Ditto, Dec. 12.</em></p>
<p>“I shall threaten the French communications and create a diversion, if the Spaniards can avail themselves of it; but the French have in the north of Spain from 80 to 90,000 men, and more are expected. Your lordship may therefore judge what will be our situation if the Spaniards do not display a determination very different from any they have shown hitherto.”</p>
<p class="p1 center"><em>Sir John Moore’s journal. Sahagan, Dec. 24, 1808.</em></p>
<p>“I gave up the march on Carrion, which had never been undertaken but with the view of attracting the enemy’s attention from the armies assembling in the south, and in the hope of being able to strike a blow at a weak corps, whilst it was still thought the British army was retreating into Portugal; for this I was aware I risked infinitely too much, but something I thought was to be risked for the honour of the service, and to make it apparent that we stuck to the Spaniards long after they themselves had given up their cause as lost.”</p>
<p class="p1 center"><em>Sir J. Moore to lord Castlereagh. Coruña, Jan. 13, 1808.</em></p>
<p>“Your lordship knows that had I followed my own opinion, as a military man, I should have retired with the army from Salamanca. The Spanish armies were then beaten; there was no Spanish force to which we could unite; and from the character of the government, and the disposition of the inhabitants, I was satisfied that no efforts would be made to aid us, or favour the cause in which they were engaged. I was sensible, however, that the apathy and indifference of the Spaniards would never have been believed; that had the British been withdrawn, the loss of the cause would have been imputed to their retreat; and it was necessary to risk this army to convince the people of England, as well as the rest of Europe, that the Spaniards had neither the power nor the inclination to make any efforts for themselves. It was for this reason that I marched to Sahagun. As a diversion it has succeeded. I brought the whole disposable force of the French against this army, and it has been allowed to follow it, without a single movement being made by any of what the Spaniards call armies to favour its retreat.”</p>
