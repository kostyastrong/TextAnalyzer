<p>Of the whole number above 800 contrived to escape to Portugal, and being united with the sick left by the regiments in that country, they formed a corps of 1876 men, which being re-embodied under the name of the battalions of detachments, did good service at Oporto and Talavera.</p>
<p><a id="Page_lxxxiv" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[lxxxiv]"></a></p>
<p>The pieces of artillery abandoned during the retreat were six 3-pounders.</p>
<p>These guns were landed at Coruña without the general’s knowledge; they never went beyond Villa Franca, and, not being horsed, were thrown down the rocks when the troops quitted that town.</p>
<p>The guns used in the battle of Coruña were spiked and buried in the sand, but the French discovered them.</p>
<p>N.B.—Some errors may have crept into the regimental states, in consequence of the difficulty of ascertaining exactly where each man was lost, but the inaccuracies could not affect the total amount above fifty men more or less.</p>
